# About

This project's purpose is to get me familiar with C++

This should be a multi-class project with the purpose of being able to easily post between multiple Twitter-like social media platforms such as:

- X
- Bluesky

There should be a class to handle:

- UI
- API Calls
- Authentication

Planned Features (if permissible with free API from each platform):
- Authenticate with your platform's credentials
- Create a post
- Attach Images
- Attach Videos
- Attach GIFs
- Convert Video to GIF (?)
- Sign out (?)
